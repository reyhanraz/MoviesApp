        Review(author: "Chris Sawin", content: "_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ isn‚Äôt without its flaws, but it is mostly exactly what it‚Äôs advertised to be. The film doesn‚Äôt necessarily redefine the, ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility,‚Äù aspect for Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man, but it without a doubt gives the MCU version of Spider-Man his version of that principle.", id: "61be4ad9c7176d0060507dc9", url: "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61be4ad9c7176d0060507dc9"),
        Review(author: "T D Heath", content: "Long awaited and very conspiricized, **'Spider-man:No way Home'** Lives up and surpasses hype, The introduction of charcters once thought cordened off into the MCU, came both as a shock and as an eventual certainty. The Pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none MCU fanatic viewers. The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end", id: "61bee9b9d371970066b9cf85", url: "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61bee9b9d371970066b9cf85"),
        Review(author: "sauceopet", content: "Best spider man movie I have ever seen. Literally got chills watching it cinema hall. Cinema hall turned into stadium. The screams, the excitement, the hype - all about it is amazing in it's own way. A total fan service.", id: "61cd6119a097dc001c3dd6b3", url: "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61cd6119a097dc001c3dd6b3"),
        Review(author: "r96sk", content: "Onto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot. This really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!", id: "61d7cd03a58902008b976594", url: "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61d7cd03a58902008b976594"),
        Review(author: "Adriano", content: "This is the perfect Marvel movie that isn't an Avengers film. It pays off everything thing it builds up, corrects previous misgivings and really gets the character of Spider-Man right. All while setting things up in an interesting way that it's bound to be fresh next time out. Absolutely loved this.", id: "61d872c5c669ad00904a2397", url: "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61d872c5c669ad00904a2397"),
        Review(author: "JPV852", content: "Good addition to the Spider-Man franchise and a quasi-reset. Fun seeing the old guard in here with Maguire and Garfield along with their foes and at least their inclusions didn't feel as forced as I feared when this movie was first announced. The relationship between Tom Holland and Zendaya worked better than in Homecoming and even Far From Home. Will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. **4.0/5**", id: "62588a74c92c5d00652ee366", url: "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62588a74c92c5d00652ee366"),
